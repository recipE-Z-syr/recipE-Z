## Understanding the Repo

First install Node.js, and expo-cli. For virtual environment, run 'pip install nodeenv', 'nodeenv env' with admin, then './env/Scripts/activate' for Windows or './env/bin/activate' for Mac.

To install dependencies, run 'npm install' to install from package.json.

Expo comes with an SDK that provides tools for apps at https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/overview/, but to install modules to make custom functions, check out ExpoKit at https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/expokit/.
